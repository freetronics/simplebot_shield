# SimpleBot Shield

This breakout shield for a wheeled robot was created to work with
@ajfisher's [SimpleBot R3](https://github.com/nodebotsau/simplebot)
design, as used for [NodeBots](http://nodebots.io) days here in Australia.

Originally designed for assembly at [LCA 2015 Open Hardware MiniConf](http://www.openhardwareconf.org/index.php/Main_Page).
